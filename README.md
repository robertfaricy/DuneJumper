# Dune Jumper
Inspired by arcade games of the past like Super Off Road or Skidmarks; Dune Jumper will be a throwback to these older isometric arcade racing games. Where the perspective of the player is in the sky looking down on the map|terrain|track. And the playable component, a dune buggy in Dune Jumperâ€™s case, moves relative to its own facing. Not in the direction of the facing of the player view, common in First Person games.
